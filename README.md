# TidalResourceEval
Codes used to evaluate tidal energy resource availability using ADCP data. Generates plots used to describe the resource and its potential usage.

This code was originally developed to analyze data for a tidal turbine to be installed at the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth New Hampshire as a part of the NSF sponsored "Living Bridge" project.

# How to use This Code
To generate the plots that this code produces download all of the files to your computer.
If you are interested in the data from the Carl Kammerer 2007 NOAA/NOS survey run the .m file under PIR0705Kammerer2007 called ADCP_Data_analysis1.m.
If you are interested in the data from the Hicks and Griffith 2014 UNH Tech 797 survey run the .m file under HicksandGriffith2014 called Resource_Evaluation.m.
Each section of code has commented title over it that breifly describes what it outputs.
Before running the code uncomment the section of code that you are interested in. Hint: to uncomment large groups of code in Matlab highlight the code you want to uncomment and press ctrl-t and to comment press ctrl-r.
